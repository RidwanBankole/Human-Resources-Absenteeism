## Introduction

Absenteeism, the consistent absence of employees, can have the ultimate implication of eroding employee engagement, damaging the company’s reputation, and hampering its overall success. As in the case of a medium-sized company, Company X, that observed a significant drop in performance, and a deep inquiry into the cause revealed absenteeism is quite a problem. This has disrupted the company’s workflow and productivity, leading to delays in project completion and compromised customer service. Additionally, the incident has significantly burdened coworkers who had to compensate for the missing team members, potentially causing burnout, decreased morale and forcing them to protest for better working conditions. At this point, the management wants to make a data-driven decision to know how to help those who are a victim of chronic absenteeism.
As the data analyst, I lead a team of 4 analysts to carry out in-depth analysis to identify hidden patterns to help the management make informed decisions. We discovered preventable health conditions that are more likely due to the unhealthy lifestyle of the employee as the primary cause of being absent from work. The project was a worthwhile journey where we were able to come up with insights and recommendations that helped the management reduce the menace before it put an end to the company's existence. 



## Goal of the Project

> Our task is to find a relatable pattern between the rate of absenteeism and season and employee information such as education level, social lifestyle, responsibility,  and body mass index. Then, we are to design an interactive Power BI dashboard that the management can use to get quick insight for making data-driven decisions to help the affected people.   

## Skills and Tools Used

* Power BI
* DAX
* Project Management: Trello Board
* Data manipulation and visualization 
* Collaboration 
* Leadership


## Task Overview

Here is a concise high-level review of the critical tasks to achieve the project goal.
* Gathered data from different sources, including SQL database and CSV text file, loading it to Power BI
* In-depth data exploration and manipulation to identify contributing features and solve data quality and structural issues such as missing values, duplicated values and outliers.
* Used DAX to create custom calculations and aggregations such as body mass index (BMI), months, season, etc, to investigate their impact on absenteeism.
* Designed an interactive dashboard for the management to make quick and data-driven decision
* Presented the insights and recommendations to technical and non-technical audiences.



## Outcome

We came up with the interactive dashboard shown below. The dashboard has two views: project overview and dashboard view, with an easy-to-use navigation bar to toggle between the pages. The dashboard can be filtered to a granular level using the apply filter button. Filters are hidden by default and become visible when clicking the apply filter button.

## Insights

Below are some valuable insights from the analysis:
* Nearly all the employees (33 out of 37) have been absent at least once due to medical reasons.
* Out of the total number of absenteeism recorded (639), medical reason accounts for 87% (555) of the reason for being absent.
* Of the 555 numbers of absenteeism from 33 employees due to medical reasons, 12 who are overweight or obese account for 272 (49%).
* Most of the 12 employees with the highest number of absenteeism due to medical reasons are either smokers, drinkers or both. And they are absent from work mainly on Monday, suggesting a social weekend.
*	The second most common reason for absenteeism (34 cases from 21 employees) is incomplete submission. 19 of the 21 employees in this category did not adhere to previous disciplinary measures, suggesting weak disciplinary action from the company. 
*	Employees who cited family-related reasons for absenteeism (11 out of 20) have neither a pet nor a child. This may imply a weak disciplinary measure.
*	11 employees have been absent 30 times without any justified reasons. This may imply weak disciplinary measures.



## Recommendations

Following the comprehensive analysis above, here are our recommendations. The management of company X should: 
*	Strengthen their discipline as employees use weak discipline to run away from work. This will reduce absenteeism by more than 20%.
*	Design a health campaign to enlighten employees about the health benefits of maintaining a good weight. This may cut off medical-related reasons by more than 30%.
*	Educate employees about the harm of smoking and drinking excessive alcohol and give support to people who want to quit.
*	 Give incentives and encouragement to the employees that do their work diligently. This will bring fulfilment and deepen employees' interest in the work.

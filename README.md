## Introduction

Absenteeism, the consistent and unexcused absence of employees from work, can have profound negative implications on a company's performance. First and foremost, it disrupts workflow and productivity, leading to delays in project completion and compromised customer service. Additionally, absenteeism significantly burdens coworkers who must compensate for the missing team members, potentially causing burnout and decreased morale. Ultimately, the cumulative impact of absenteeism can erode employee engagement, damage the company's reputation, and hamper its overall success.


## Goal of the Project

> The primary goal of this analysis is to design an interactive Power BI dashboard that will give quick insights into the factors contributing to chronic absenteeism within the company's workforce by analyzing the human resources dataset.

## Problem Statements

The medium-sized company noticed a drop in performance from the team. A closer investigation into the causes reveals chronic absenteeism is quite a problem. As a data analyst in the company, I am tasked to use Human Resources Absenteeism data to design a Power BI dashboard that will provide quick insights to help the management help those missing work.

## Skills and Tools Used
* PowerBI
* DAX
* Project Management: Trello Board
* Data Visualization
* Data Cleaning
* Data Exploartion 

## Data Visualization Processing

The project commenced with importing the dataset into Power BI, facilitating my familiarization with its contents. Subsequently, I defined specific causal factors to investigate within the dataset. I then created new features, such as BMI, seasonal attributes, and employee ages, by using advanced DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) techniques. To present the findings in an accessible manner, I designed visually engaging dashboards using Power BI's array of visualization tools and features.



## Dashboard

The dashboard within the Human Resources domain is shown below. It has two views: project overview and dashboard view. The project overview gave an account of the problem statement, while the dashboard shows key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard can be filtered to a granular level using the apply filter button. Filters hidden by default become visible when clicking the apply filter button.

The menu button on the left pane of the dashboard facilitates navigation through the dashboard.
